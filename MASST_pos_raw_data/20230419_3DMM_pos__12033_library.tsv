mzspec:GNPS:GNPS-LIBRARY:accession:CCMSLIB00005788027	CCMSLIB00005788027	0.81	7	Our team detected a feature with assigned 228.1956 m/z value. It's part of our data from a BCAEC metabolomic's analysis using a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer. If you find a peak with similar m/z value and the assigned MS2 matches our's, please contact us as it is important to understand BCAEC metabolome's changes under simulated T2DM culture condition. As additional information, SIRIUS 4.5.0 assigns C13H25NO2 as the most probable formula.  	M+H	1
